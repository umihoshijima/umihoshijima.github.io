### *I am very interested in how an organism's physiology responds to a changing environment.*


I have explored this relationship in a variety of invertebrate systems, focusing largely on early developmental stages. I am currently scaling this work up to communities and ecosystems.


### Kelp Forest grazers in Southeast Alaska

 My postdoctoral work has focused on the interaction between marine grazers and the high seasonal fluctuation of pH and temperature in the kelp forests of southeast Alaska! I take an energetics approach to understanding the limits of compensation, resilience, and plasticity to future change.

### Purple Sea Urchins in Southern California

 *Strongylocentrotus purpuratus*

In the California Current, the large-scale seasonal drivers of pH and temperature are relatively well-understood. Less poorly understood, however, is the spatiotemporally disparate local drivers – e.g. the ability of seasonally stratified water to create more intense low-pH/oxygen regimes in the nearshore, as well as the contributing effect of large-standing photosynthetic biomass (kelp, seagrass). With the development of new technology allowing for the autonomous, stable logging of pH, these drivers, previously considered minutia in relation to the larger-scale drivers, are now being considered for its potential to adapt stress-resistant populations, or conversely, the potential to create refugia to harbor vulnerable populations among the mosaic of pH and oxygen regimes throughout the CCLME.

### Juvenile thecosome pteropods in Antarctica

My work on Antarctic pteropods (*Limacina helicina antarctica*) has been published in Conservation Physiology [here](https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/5/1/cox064/4670933).

With this work, we sought to investigate how Antarctic pteropods – a shelled zooplankton – would fare under current and future extremes of pH when combined with a near-future temperature stress. We decided to measure metabolic rate via respirometry, measuring how much oxygen the organisms respired at various conditions.

We ultimately found that pteropods responded to low pH stress by increasing their resting metabolism. This interacted additively with temperature stress, indicating that pteropods would need to devote more energy into resting metabolism, pH regulation and shell repair under near-future conditions.
