> # Objectives:
> * Become familiar with the R environment
> * Learn how to do math and assign values to variables/objects
> * Use comments to inform the script
> * Import a spreadsheet of data
> * Exploring a data frame
> * Explore plotting the data
> * Pointing you towards future resources


You can get output from R simply by typing math in the console:

```
3 + 5  
12 / 7  
```

However, we want more than a fancy calculator right? You were promised so much more! Things become very interesting when you can **assign values to objects**. To create an object, we need to give it a name, then the assignment operator `<-`, then the value we want to give it:

```
weight_kg <- 55
```

We have now put the value of `55` "into" `weight_kg`.
