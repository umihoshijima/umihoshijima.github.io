In the next few hours we will be covering the first steps to scientific programming from scratch.

### Before we start:
* Download R following this link: [Link to R website](http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/)
* Download "R Studio Desktop" following this link: [Link to R Studio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

Our schedule will look something like this:

* *Coffee / Snack Break*
* [Intro to R Part 2](http://umi.science/r_intro_201907_pt2/):

### Future Resources:

* Content from this was adapted from various carpentries workshops, all of which I am certified to instruct:   [Data Carpentry Ecology Curriculum](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#ecology-workshop), [R for reproducible scientific analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/), and [Programming with R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/).
