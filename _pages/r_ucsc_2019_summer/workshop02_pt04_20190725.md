# Objectives:
> * Review use of logic in R with logical indexing
> * Learn why we might want to use an "if" statement
> * Think about how an "if" statement is used differently in comparison to a function
> * Learn the structure of a simple if statements and apply it.
> * Add complexity to our logic with & and | (and, or)
> * Add an "else" statement so that an alternative happens when the statement is false.
> * Work with "else if" statements to add further complexity to the code.

# Reviewing Logic:

Let's go back over some of the "logical indexing" and "logical operations" that we covered two weeks ago:

```
weight <- 10
# Is weight bigger than 5?
weight >5 #TRUE
# Is weight less than 5?
weight <5 #FALSE
# is weight less than or equal to 10?
weight <=10 #TRUE
# is weight equal to 10?
weight ==10 #TRUE
# is weight "not equal" to 10?
weight !=10 #FALSE
# also works on strings:
animal = 'cat'
animal == 'cat' #TRUE
animal != 'cat' #FALSE
```

| Symbol | Meaning                  |
|--------|--------------------------|
| <      | Less than                |
| <=     | Less than or equal to    |
| >      | Greater than             |
| >=     | Greater than or equal to |
| ==     | equal to                 |
| !=     | Not equal to             |

# Introducing if statements

Instead of using these like we did last time with [logical indexing]({{ site.url }}/r_ucsc_2019_summer/pt1), we are going to use these logical operators to have R choose what code to run. These are called `if statements` and look like this:


```
if(Q GOES HERE){
  # code only runs if logic is TRUE
}
```

Let's give this a try with a single weight, using print:
```
# The function "print" prints text out in the console:
print('text')
if(weight == 10){
  'The weight is 10.''
}
```

## Challenge 1:

> Write an if statement that prints "Num is positive", when the value of the variable num is positive.

### Answer:

```
num = 10
if(num>0){
  print('Num is positive')
}
```

# Adding additional complexity with "and", "or"...


R knows how to use these logical operators on both strings and numbers. However we can **combine** these logical operators using two commands: **&** and **|**.

Let's start with **&**:

*Both things must be true:*
```
TRUE & FALSE
TRUE & TRUE
FALSE & TRUE
weight==10 & weight <10
weight==10 & weight<=10
```

Now with or, **|**, Only one of the things have to be true:

```
TRUE | FALSE
TRUE | TRUE
FALSE | TRUE
weight==10 | weight <10
weight==10 | weight<=10
```

## Challenge:

>* write a logical operator that prints "the number is within 2 of 0". if the number is between -2 and 2.

### Answer:

```
if(num>-2 & num<2){
  print('the number is within 2 of zero.')
}
```
