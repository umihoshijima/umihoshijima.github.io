**This is still in flux**. Feel free to glance through the lessons, but they are bound to change before the workshop.

## Before we start:
* Download R following this link: [Link to R website](http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/)
* Download "R Studio Desktop" following this link: [Link to R Studio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* If you have issues with these installations, **Please come a few minutes early.**
* If you do not have a portable computer that you cannot bring, I may be able to provide one for you. **Please [email me](mailto:uhoshiji@ucsc.edu)**.

## Our schedule will look something like this:

In the next few hours we will be covering the first steps to scientific programming from scratch.
*This workshop assumes no prior programming knowledge.*

* [Intro to R Part 1]({{ site.url }}/r_ucsb_2019/pt1/): Fundamentals of programming, using functions, data types, importing and manipulating data.
* *Break*
* [Intro to R Part 2]({{ site.url }}/r_ucsb_2019/pt2/): Manipulate and plot data.

## Future Resources:

* Content from this was adapted from various carpentries workshops:   [Data Carpentry Ecology Curriculum](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/#ecology-workshop), [R for reproducible scientific analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/), and [Programming with R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/).
