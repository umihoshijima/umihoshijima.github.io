I explore the complex relationship between an organism and its environment through ecophysiology and autonomous sensor deployments. I am currently scaling this work up to communities and ecosystems. Here is a brief synopses of some of my major projects to date:

### Kelp Forest grazers in Southeast Alaska

 My postdoctoral work has focused on the interaction between marine grazers and the high seasonal fluctuation of pH and temperature in the kelp forests of Southeast Alaska! I take an energetics approach to understanding the limits of compensation, resilience, and plasticity to future change.

### Purple Sea Urchins in Southern California

* Variability of seawater chemistry in a kelp forest environment is linked to *in situ* transgenerational effects in the purple sea urchin, *Strongylocentrotus purpuratus* (in press)

In the California Current, the large-scale seasonal drivers of pH and temperature are relatively well-understood. Less poorly understood, however, is the spatiotemporally disparate local drivers – e.g. the ability of seasonally stratified water to create more intense low-pH/oxygen regimes in the nearshore, as well as the contributing effect of large-standing photosynthetic biomass (kelp, seagrass). I considered its potential to adapt stress-resistant populations, or conversely, the potential to create refugia to harbor vulnerable populations among the mosaic of pH and oxygen regimes throughout the coast.

### Juvenile pteropods in Antarctica
<a id="limacina"></a>

With this work, we sought to investigate how Antarctic pteropods – a shelled zooplankton – would fare under current and future extremes of pH when combined with a near-future temperature stress. We decided to measure metabolic rate via respirometry, measuring how much oxygen the organisms respired at various conditions.

We ultimately found that pteropods responded to low pH stress by increasing their resting metabolism. This interacted additively with temperature stress, indicating that pteropods would need to devote more energy into resting metabolism, pH regulation and shell repair under near-future conditions.
