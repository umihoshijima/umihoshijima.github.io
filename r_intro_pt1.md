# Why R?


>I already know how to use excel, and have done some statistics in other programs (e.g. JMP). Why do I need to learn ANOTHER thing?


You've may have heard of the importance of  `reproducible science`. In a well-written paper, all of the technical steps are laid out so somebody else can replicate the experiment exactly with the information given. These `reproducible methods` are super important for scientific progress.

This same idea applies to data analysis!  In a perfect world, I want to see your original entered data sheet (the one you typed in the data onto), as well as every step along the way (until you get to your final graphs and statistics). This can be hard for me to see in excel. I would often drag data around to make it easier to plot. Then I might make a calculation column with an equation, then make another column with equations, etc... until I end up with a completely different spreadsheet from where I started! This means that it's hard to retrace your steps and know everything that you did.

If you do all of this data formatting, calculation, plotting, and stats in a `programming language`, it is automatically keeping a track of everything you are doing. Every line of code is a "step" between your raw data and your result!

More and more journals nowadays expect that your programming code and your raw data are made available online. This means that even Scientific programming isn't just for quantitative biologists anymore! Power to the people!

# Starting with variables

You can get output from R simply by typing math in the console:

```
3 + 5  
12 / 7  
```

However, we want more than a fancy calculator right? You were promised so much more! Things become very interesting when you can **assign values to objects**. To create an object, we need to give it a name, then the assignment operator `<-`, then the value we want to give it:

```
weight_kg <- 55
```

We have now put the value of `55` "into" `weight_kg`.

```
weight_kg
```

Object names can't start with a number (e.g. `2ndTreatment` is no good but `treatment_2` works). In general you don't want to give something a name that's already taken. If we make another thing called `weight_kg`, we will "overwrite" the first one:

```
weight_kg <- 60
# Type name of object to print
weight_kg
```

Now that r "remembers" `weight_kg`, we can do some math with it! Let's find out what 60kg is in pounds:

```
# pounds is 2.2x kg.
2.2 * weight_kg
# did that change weight_kg?
weight_kg
```

We can also change an objectâ€™s value by assigning it a new one:

```
weight_kg <- 57.5
2.2 * weight_kg
```

let's save the result of this calculation to a new variable, ``weight_lb`:

```
weight_lb <- 2.2 * weight_kg
weight_lb
# change weight_kg:
weight_kg <- 100
# what is the result here?
weight_kg
# what about now?
weight_kg <- weight_kg / 2
```

### Using functions in R  

You're likely going to very quickly want to do something a little more than addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in R. For this we will use our own *functions* that allow us to do more complex operations. A function executes a more complex chunk of code. Functions look a bit like variables, but have parentheses after them. the "input" of the function goes into these parentheses.
