I am broadly interested in the extent to which organisms are adapted to their environment, and how that could confer resilience to global change. My work has generally focused in temperate reef systems, as well as polar environments.

A little more about me:

* As a first-generation immigrant, I have had shockingly few science role models that share my racial  and bicultural identity. I am passionate about making science inclusive for students of varied backgrounds.

* As a multi-instrumentalist musician, I advocate the work-life balance of having an identity parallel to being an academic. I am also interested in ways to communicate science through art and music.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz with the [Kroeker Lab](http://kristy-kroeker.squarespace.com/). Previously, I was a PhD student working with the [Hofmann Lab](http://www.hofmannlab.com/) in the department of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
