I am broadly interested in the extent to which organisms are adapted to their environment, and how that could confer resilience to global change. My work has generally focused in temperate reef systems, as well as polar environments.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz with the [Kroeker Lab](http://kristy-kroeker.squarespace.com/). Previously, I was a PhD student working with the [Hofmann Lab](http://www.hofmannlab.com/) in the department of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I did my undergraduate work at UC Santa Cruz, where I studied biology, chemistry, and electronic music.

The purpose of this blog is to serve as a supplement to my [official profile on my lab page](http://kristy-kroeker.squarespace.com/people-1/), and will hopefully give you a better idea of who I am as an academic and a human being. You can learn more about me through my CV or by contacting me directly at <umihoshijima@gmail.com> .
